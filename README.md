# 1. Raw data: config & data files

Each observation is represented by of pair of files: 

* **measurement file** `.dat` - e.g.:  `16.03.2019-18.37.32.dat`

|  | Time | T_set1 | T_set2 | T_set_3 | T_set4 | N_cycle | Phase | T1 | R1 | T2 | R2 | T3 | R3 | T4 | R4 | 
| :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |
| 0 | 0.26 | 100.0 | 150.0 | 150.0 | 150.0 | 1 | 3 | 6.796659 | 1017631.0 | 16.99999 | 3738238.0 | 13.96551 | 364169200.0 | 16.15645 | 138198600.0 |
| 1 | 0.37 | 100.0 | 150.0 | 150.0 | 150.0 | 1 | 3 | 9.633535 | 918182.3 | 21.88888 | 3400904.0 | 19.02298 | 247933100.0 | 20.91836 | 86560560.0 |

- `Time`: time in seconds from start of the experiment (sampling rate ~0.1sec);
- `T_set*`: temperature (Celsius) set by the heater control program, `*` - sensor number (1-4)
- `N_cycle`: the number of measurement period (each cycle ~60sec long; consists of phases 3-4-5-6)
- `Phases`: heater operating modes:
    - 3 - stable-bottom; 
    - 4 - heating;
    - 5 - stable-top;
    - 6 - cooling;
- `T*`: observed temperature (Celsius) `*` - sensor number (1-4);
- `R*`: observed sensor resistance `*` - sensor number (1-4);


* **config file** `.xlsx` - e.g.: `16.03.2019-18.37.32.xlsx`

|  | time | gas | conc ppm |
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
| 0 | 0 | air | 0 |
| 1 | 3600 | H2 | 1600 |
| 2 | 7200 | air | 0 |
| 3 | 10800 | propane | 1600 |

- `time`: time in seconds from start of the experiment 
>    Example: 
>    * 0 row: `0 air 0` -  urban air (any addition gas concentration = 0ppm) was oberved during 0-3600sec from experiment starting
>    * 1 row: `3600 H2 1600` - H2 at concentration 1600ppm was observed at 3600-7200sec
>    * 2 row: `7200 air 0` - air was observed at 7200-10800sec
>    * 3 row: `10800 propane 1600` - propane at concentration 1600ppm was oberved after 10800sec
 
    
- `gas`: observed gas;
- `conc ppm`: gas concentration parts per million.

## 2. Prepared data: R & T observations

Because our main goal - gas classification, we have prepared files where each cycle\period is presented as a separate samples.

You could find files in root folder `./cropped_data`. This folder consists of folders `air, h2, propane` with measurement files for corresponding gas. There are pairs of files (R & T) for each experiment session (config file row number):

Example:
> 2 of numerous files in `./cropped_data/h2/`:
>
> `16.03.2019_R1_1600_num2.csv` & `16.03.2019_T1_1600_num2.csv`
>
> filenames have information about:
> - `23.03.2019` - experiment date;
> - `R` - measurement type (`R` - resistance; `T` - temperatire (Celsius));
> - `1` - sensor number;
> - `1600` - gas concentration;
> - `num2` - row number at **config file** for these measurements subset (here = 2)

The structure of typical observation file (here `16.03.2019_R1_1600_num2.csv`):

|  | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | ... | 547 | 548 | 549 | 550 |
| :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |
| 0 | 1600 | 17780.8 | 17669.34 | 17909.73 | ... | 12127.51 | 12351.3 | 12496.23 | 12587.69 |
| 1 | 1600 | 12458.27 | 12427.96 | 12451.9 | ... | 10438.04 | 10489.96 | 10574.12 | 10580.16 |
| 2 | 1600 | 10470.03 | 10603.79 | 10604.77 | ... | 9784.31 | 9763.056 | 9759.589 | 9591.474 |

* first column\row - just dummy indexes;
* **column index** `0` - **gas concentration** (here 1600ppm, as expected from filename);
* each row has **resistance** (temperature, if `T` at filename) values at **column indexes** `1-550` for current cycle\period;
